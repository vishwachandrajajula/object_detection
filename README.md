This project focuses on implementing real-time 
object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only 
Look Once, version 3) algorithm. YOLOv3 is a 
state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its 
speed and accuracy in detecting and classifying 
multiple objects within an image or video feed. The 
primary goal of the project is to process live video 
input and detect objects by drawing bounding boxes 
and labeling them with their respective class names 
and confidence scores.
